```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      comment = "#>",
                      collapse = TRUE,
                      dev = "ragg_png",

# Support Repo for {ggplot2} tutorial

This is for the code-alongers that had troubble installing {hypoimg}.
It contains the specific data and functions of the package that are used in the tutorial (so you can load those without installing the package).

You need to have the {tidyverse} and {grImport2} installed though:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("grImport2")
```

Then instead of calling `library(hypoimg)`, you can load this small script provided here:

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.asp= .55,fig.align = "center"}
source("hypoimg_minimal.R")
```

Here are two quick tests to see if it loaded the data correctly:

Check the hamlet functions and data:

```{r test1, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.asp= .55, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot() +
  hypo_anno_l("puella")
```

Check the import functions:

```{r test2, fig.width = 6, fig.asp= .55, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot() +
  annotation_custom(hypo_read_svg("logo.c.svg") %>% 
                      hypo_recolor_svg(color = "#FB794B"))
```

If those two plots work you should be set :)
